# Deep Dives

Supplementary technical essays that go deeper than the main 12-chapter narrative allows. Each Deep Dive is self-contained and can be read independently, but links back to the relevant main chapters.

These are **optional reading** — the main chapters (1–12) tell a complete story from private keys to Silent Payments. Deep Dives provide the "why behind the why" — historical context, cross-cutting architectural patterns, and hands-on experiments that didn't fit the main flow.
