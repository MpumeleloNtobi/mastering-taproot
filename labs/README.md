# Mastering Taproot Labs

Structured engineering checkpoints for the [Mastering Taproot Lab](../LAB.md) cohort.

Each week:

1. **Think** — read the questions  
2. **Write** — copy `template.md`, answer in your own words  
3. **Submit** — PR to `submissions/` with your name  
4. **Verify** — (later weeks may add code + testnet checks)

Clarity > length. Engineers think by writing.

## Format

- `week-NN/` — one folder per checkpoint  
- Each week: `README.md` (tasks + questions), `template.md` (copy & fill), `submissions/` (where PRs land)

---

## Submission Rules

1. Fork the repo  
2. Copy `week-NN/template.md` → `week-NN/submissions/yourname.md`  
3. Fill in your answers  
4. Open PR  

No pressure on perfection. The best 2–3 submissions may be discussed in the next session.
